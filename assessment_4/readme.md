# Function-Frontend

This is a web3 project that demonstrates the interaction of the smart contract with the front-end application.

# Description

Firstly we have created a stand-alone web page using html, css and js. This webpage displays the token information in a well-defined manner.
Then we have created a smart contract and deployed it on sepolia test-chain. This contract contains the token information and function for fetching the information.
Then we have created a new project on the alchemy which is a web3 provider. Using the api key, we are able to log all the transaction that take place on this network.
Finally we extract the contract adress and the abi from the deployed contract and use them to call the functions for retrieving the information and then displaying in on the webpage.
